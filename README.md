Last/Leo Abstract Syntax Tree Parser (provisional name)

The overall goal is to publish [Leo Editor][1]'s [AST parser][2] as a standalone library that can be used by any python project.

This repo is highly experimental while we figure the best way to package the project. The library however has a lot of development and testing behind it and is not (so) experimental.
